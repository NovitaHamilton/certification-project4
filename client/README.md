Interactive task manager application with React-Redux, Node-Express, NoSQL DB, Testing &amp; Security

### Instructions
1. Develop an interactive task manager application with the following requirements:
 - [x]  The application should support multiple task lists, thereby being able to create, update, and delete a task list.
 - [x]  The user should have the option to add, delete, and update tasks in a task list. Some criteria that must exist in a task include priority (high, medium, low), completion status (todo, in progress, completed), and due date (date).
 - [x]  The user should be able to display (on web page) the task lists, and also each respective task within the task lists.
 - [x]  The user should be able to save Task lists to localStorage, or load Task lists from localStorage.

2. You will be required to add persistence in the form of loading from and saving to localStorage files:
 - [x]  Saving to or loading from localStorage. You only need to save when someone actually clicks save, and loads on clicking load. No need to save every change made, or load on the first load of your application.
 - [x]  The following documentation should be helpful: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage

3. Given the interactive nature of this implementation:
 - [x] Feel free to make use of React components to accomplish this task.
 - [x]  Itâ€™s advisable to first complete the application without any Redux, and then once everything is working, think about how you can use Redux to minimize the useState usage.
 - [ ] We will provide a slide covering how to approach adding Redux.
